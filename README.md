Sound creation tool for the Apple II

Sounding Board is a visual editor for creating interesting sounds with just the built-in Apple II speaker that I wrote for Compute!'s Apple Applications a very long time ago.  It appeared in the August, 1988 issue.  I'm particularly proud of this one since I have little to no musical ability and this took me out of my comfort zone.  You might even say it pushes the envelope.
